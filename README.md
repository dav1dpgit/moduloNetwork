Bitcoin spreadsheets for learning and fun in Microsoft Excel, no macros and no array formulas, including the first bitcoin ECDSA secp256k1 curve Excel spreadsheet, SHA256 spreadsheet, RIPEMD-160, base 58 and bech32 spreadsheets

The ECDSA binanry file is called "folded" because 181 identical (but crucial) tabs in the spreadsheet have been deleted in order to fit the file into github, so to make the spreadsheet work you will need to "unfold" the spreadsheet by adding back these tabs.  Take these following steps
1) Download the ECDSA binary excel file
2) Change to Sheet4 tab
3) Add a new tab by clicking the '+' button at the bottom of the screen that adds tabs
4) The new tab should automatically be called 'Sheet5"
5) Repeat the aforementioned process to add additional tabs until you reach Sheet185 (yes, add 181 extra tabs)
6) Copy the entire tab of Sheet4
7) Highlight all tabs from Sheet5 to Sheet185 and paste the entire contents of Sheet4 into every sheet from tab Sheet5 to Sheet185.  This should be automatically done if you highlighted all sheets properly.
8) After excel completes the pasting necessary, save the file and test the output multiple times against a reliable ECDSA secp256k1 calculator to make sure nothing went wrong.

That should give you the file you need to have some fun with the ECDSA binary file
